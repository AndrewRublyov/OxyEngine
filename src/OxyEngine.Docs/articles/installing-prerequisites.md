## .NET Framework (Windows)

You need to install **[.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=56116)** or a newer version. For other operating systems, you need to install **Mono**.

## Mono (Linux, Mac OS)

**Mono** is a cross-platform .NET Framework implementation. Installation instructions can be found on the website **[Mono Project](http://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)**.

If you use Windows, we also recommend you to install Mono. Thus, you can immediately check for correct work on a single runtime.

## MonoGame

In order to start development on OxyEngine, you also need to install **MonoGame SDK**.
1. Select the actual version of MonoGame at **[this page](http://www.monogame.net/downloads/)**.
2. Select the appropriate installation method for your operating system. For Windows, it is recommended to use "MonoGame for VisualStudio", since it contains everything you need for easy development in Visual Studio, including project templates.
