# Getting Started

These instructions will get you information to get started with engine.


## Prerequisites

### Mono

If you are on Linux or MacOS, you need to install Mono SDK for debugging and running .NET executables.

Latest Mono SDK can be found **[here](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)**.

### MonoGame

You need to install MonoGame SDK to compile assets and using ready-to-use remplates.

Latest MonoGame SDK can be found **[here](http://www.monogame.net/downloads/)**.


## Tutorials

You can found tutorials on the **[wiki page](wiki)**.

## Compatibility

### Desktop
OxyEngine has only 2 native dependencies for Desktop from MonoGame: **OpenAL** and **SDL2**. Both of them are shipped with OxyPlayground and you also need to provide these libs to get OxyEngine project to launch.

More info in first tutorial.

## Installing
This section will show you how to install OxyEngine into your .NET project.

### From NuGet (preffered)
We are using custom MyGet feed. You need to add this feed to your NuGet PM.

#### NuGet V3:
`https://www.myget.org/F/oxyteam/api/v3/index.json`

#### NuGet V2:
`https://www.myget.org/F/oxyteam/api/v2`

After that, install Oxy.Engine **[NuGet package](https://www.myget.org/feed/oxyteam/package/nuget/Oxy.Framework)**. This is best choice for beginners.

### Building from sources (advanced)
To install stable version of OxyEngine into your .NET Core App:
1. Ð¡lone this repository:
 `git clone https://github.com/OxyTeam/OxyEngine.git` 
  Use **master** branch for only stable and production-ready code. 
  You also can use **default** branch, but it may be unstable.
2. Select preffered configuration and Build solution.
3. Reference OxyEngine.dll and other dependencies to you project.
