# OxyEngine
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/tyg13hjkm01vb3yd?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AndrewRublyov/oxyengine-y2q1n)


**OxyEngine** is a full-featured cross-platform 2D game engine that allows you to develop games using **C#** and **Python**.

---
---
***Please note: This project in very early stage of development, do not use it for any production projects before first public release. At this time, OxyEngine does not guarantee backward compatibility and stability of your code.***

---
---
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you information for getting started with engine.

For now, only  low-level API for graphics, input, window and resources modules are implemented. This part of engine is called **Oxy.Framework**.

In future you will be able to create games using high-level **Oxy.Engine** part of the project, such as powerfull visual editor called **Oxy.Editor**.

### Prerequisites

OxyEngine is a .NET Core project. To create .NET Core applications you need to install .NET Core SDK on you system

Any Desktop operation system is supported (Windows, MacOS X, Linux).
Your graphics card must support **OpenGL 3.2+**.

### Installing
This section will show you how to install OxyEngine into your .NET Core 2.0 App.

#### From NuGet
For now, we will not provide any NuGet packagaes, because we do not have any releases yet.

#### From project sources
To install stable version of OxyEngine into your :
* Ð¡lone this repository:
 `git clone https://github.com/OxyTeam/OxyEngine.git` 
  use **master** branch for only stable and production-ready code. 
  You also can use **default** branch, but it may not build or will work not properly.
* Build **Oxy.Framework.TestPlayer** project (that command will build all needed modules) with
  `dotnet build`
  and reference compiled dll's (Oxy.Framework assemblies) to your .NET Core App project.
  **OR** 
  you can reference Oxy.Framework.* projects directly without using compiled dll's
  
### Hello, World! 

"Hello World!" example using low-level Oxy.Framework.

Create folders `scripts` (folder for your Python scripts) and `library`(for game assets) in your app project folder. Make sure they will be copied to build output folder. You can rename folders to any name you want, but better use this for future compatibility

Also this example use custom .ttf font **that must be placed into `library` folder**, you can use any font you want with this example.
  
#### Example using only C#

**Program.cs:**
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace Oxy.Framework.TestPlayer
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      // Set scripts root folder. All script paths will be relative to this folder
      Common.SetScriptsRoot(Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, "scripts"));
      // Set library root folder. All asset paths will be relative to this folder
      Common.SetLibraryRoot(Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, "library"));

      // Text object for "Hello, World!" text
      TextObject textObj = null;
      
      // Callback for OnLoad event to load and initialize all things
      Window.OnLoad(() =>
      {
        // Load our custom font
        var font = Resources.LoadFont("roboto.ttf");
        // Create text object
        textObj = Graphics.NewText(font, "Hello, World!");
      });      
      
      // OnDraw is called every frame to draw graphics on screen
      // Graphics.Draw will draw text object on screen
      Window.OnDraw(() => Graphics.Draw(textObj, 50, 50));
      
      // Start gameloop (at 60 FPS by default)
      Window.Show();
    }
  }
}
```
Thats all. Build and run this example to see result.

#### Example using Python + C#

This is more preffered way to use Oxy.Framework.

**scripts/game.py:**
```python
# Import all Oxy.Framework modules
from Oxy.Framework import *

# This function will be called after window is get ready
def onLoad():
    global textObj
    # Load our custom font
    font = Resources.LoadFont("roboto.ttf", 48)
    # Create text object
    textObj = Graphics.NewText(font, "Hello World OxyEngine!")
    
# This function Will be called every frame to draw graphics on screen
def onDraw():
    # Graphics.Draw will draw text object on screen
    Graphics.Draw(textObj, 50, 50)

# Setup event listeners for Load and Draw
Window.OnLoad(onLoad)
Window.OnDraw(onDraw)

# Start gameloop (at 60 FPS by default)
Window.Show()
```

**Program.cs:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace Oxy.Framework.TestPlayer
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      // Set scripts root folder. All script paths will be relative to this folder
      Common.SetScriptsRoot(Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, "scripts"));
      // Set library root folder. All asset paths will be relative to this folder
      Common.SetLibraryRoot(Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, "library"));
      // Execute script
      Common.ExecuteScript("game.py");
    }
  }
}
```

Result of both implementations:

## Built With
OxyEngine uses some third-party libraries and tools:

* [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk) - Open Toolkit library is a fast, low-level C# wrapper for OpenGL and OpenAL.
  (we are using [OpenTK.NETCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK.NETCore/) package for .NET Core compatibility)
* [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/) - the Python programming language for the .NET Framework
* [DLR](https://github.com/IronLanguages/dlr) - Open source implementation of Dynamic Language Runtime
